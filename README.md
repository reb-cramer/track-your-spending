# Track Your Spending

Track Your Spending is a web application that interacts with my [spending database](https://github.com/reb-cramer/spending-database). The app will allow you to query the database, insert new records into the database, and edit the database. In the future, I want to add a budgeting feature to the application, which will allow users to build a budget, compare it with their spending habits, and note areas for improvement.
